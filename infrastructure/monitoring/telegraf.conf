#   ##   postgres://[pqgotest[:password]]@localhost[/dbname]\

#   ## or a simple string:
#   ##   host=localhost user=pqotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
#   #
#   ## All connection parameters are optional.  #
#   ## Without the dbname parameter, the driver will default to a database
#   ## with the same name as the user. This dbname is just for instantiating a
#   ## connection with the server and doesn't restrict the databases we are trying
#   ## to grab metrics for.
#   #
#   address = "host=localhost user=postgres sslmode=disable"

#   ## databases are gathered.

#   ## measurement output. If not specified, a default one generated from
#   ## the connection address is used.

#   ## Define the toml config where the sql queries are stored
#   ## New queries can be added, if the withdbname is set to true and there is no
#   ## databases defined in the 'databases field', the sql query is ended by a
#   ## 'is not null' in order to make the query succeed.
#   ## Example :
#   ## The sqlquery : "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database where datname" become
#   ## "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database where datname IN ('postgres', 'pgbench')"
#   ## because the databases variable was set to ['postgres', 'pgbench' ] and the
#   ## withdbname was true. Be careful that if the withdbname is set to false you
#   ## don't have to define the where clause (aka with the dbname) the tagvalue
#   ## field is used to define custom tags (separated by commas)
#   ## The optional "measurement" value can be used to override the default
#   ## output measurement name ("postgresql").
